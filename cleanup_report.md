# Website Cleanup Report

## Files Kept (Currently Used)
These files are actively used in your website and have been preserved:

- HTML Files:
  - index.html
  - projects.html
  - certificates.html

- JavaScript Files:
  - chatbot.js
  - friendship.js
  - games.js
  - interactive-options.js

- Other:

  - Images and Files directories

## Files Moved to to_remove (Unused)
These files appear to be unused or duplicated and have been moved to the to_remove directory:

- fixed-chatbot-with-icon.js
- master-fixed-chatbot.js
- package-lock.json

## Backup Directory
The backup directory contains older versions of files that are likely not needed in your main website. These include:

- Various test scripts
- Old versions of your chatbot implementation
- Diagnostic tools
- Partial fixes that have been integrated into your main files

## Next Steps

1. Review the files in the to_remove directory to confirm they are not needed.
2. Review the backup directory to see if any files contain code you want to preserve.
3. Once you've confirmed, you can delete the files using:
   ```
   rm -rf to_remove
   ```
4. If you determine the backup directory is no longer needed, you can move it to to_remove and then delete everything:
   ```
   mv backup to_remove/
   rm -rf to_remove
   ```

This cleanup will make your website structure cleaner and easier to maintain.
